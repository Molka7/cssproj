                <small>Photography and videography are not just a craft to me—they are a way to preserve fleeting moments and turn them into lasting memories. My name is Max Caufield, and I am an American-French photographer and videographer. With nearly a decade of experience, my journey began at 15, driven by a deep passion for capturing the essence of life. Specializing in portraits, landscapes, and events, I aim to create work that speaks to the emotions of each moment. Every shot I take is a commitment to preserving what’s beautiful, meaningful, and true—casting it forever in a frame, finding depth and meaning in every image, and creating timeless pieces that tell a story beyond what’s seen.</small>
